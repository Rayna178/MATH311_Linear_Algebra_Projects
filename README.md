# MATH311_Linear_Algebra_Projects

This is a repository of projects for the Math 311 Linear Algebra course at Winona State University. It uses Google Colab and coding in Python to explore linear algebra concepts.

# Projects:

1: Solve Systems Using Colab and Python, https://github.com/Rayna178/MATH311_Linear_Algebra_Projects/blob/main/Copy_of_Math_311_solve_systems_using_computation_and_rref.ipynb

2: The Ski Hill - Transitions Matricies and Markov Chins: Modeing future behavior using transisiton matrices,
